    I study a lot of subjects at school.
    I study Mathematics, Ukrainian, Reading, English, Arts, and Music.
    English is my favourite subject.
    Our English lessons are very interesting.
    We learn new words and write exercises.
    We read texts and translate them.
    We play games and tell dialogues.
    I love English and I want to be an English teacher.
    I also read English books, magazines and newspapers.
    I watch video films and listen to songs in English.
    I have a Walkman, so I often listen to songs or teaching cassettes when walking or in the underground.
    I write new words on little cards and look them through every evening before going to sleep.
    I hope that in the future Iâ€™ll speak English fluently!
